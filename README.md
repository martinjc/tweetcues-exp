=============

A web-based experiment looking at information cues on Twitter. Implemented using Django and Tweepy, the experiment asks users to complete a survey looking at how and which information influences their decisions on which tweets to read.

The initial results of the data analysis from running the experiment were published at SocialCom 2012 as the paper "Better the tweeter you know: social signals on Twitter" (doi: 10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.27), available from http://martinjc.com/research/publications/
